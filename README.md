### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Have you ever heard the term multipotentialite? If not, I invite you to keep reading!

My mind is often floating with new ideas and I relish studying multiple fields and areas. Currently, I'm a frontend engineer with a passion for crafting inclusive and accessible user experiences that everyone can enjoy. The web should be for everyone - it's a personal mantra for me. Working in this area and being a naturally curious person, I also like to study the area of UI/UX - this knowledge allows me to grasp some product concepts and think about the web in a more broad spectrum beyond engineering.

A little backstory about me: I have a master's degree in Clinical Psychology. Even though studying the human mind and behaviour was something I enjoyed & that created an important foundation for my understanding of people & human behaviour, I always had a profound interest in coding and all things related to technology, namely playing with WordPress and HTML during my high-school years and seeing how things worked on the Web. 

Programming keeps me continuously learning, and that's what defines me: I'm a learner at heart & that's my superpower! 

I'm quickly galvanised by multiple subjects, from coding to plants, to learning a new language, which means that I need to be constantly driven to learn new things and to always be in an environment that keeps me challenged. 

Beyond crafting web experiences, you will probably find me with a cup of coffee or tea, reading a good book, listening to a podcast or with my cats.
