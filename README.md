Hi! 👋

A frontend engineer with 5+ years of experience, passionate about crafting inclusive and accessible user experiences for everyone. 

The web should be for all - “Focus on the user and all else will follow.” Thriving at the intersection of frontend engineering, product design (UI/UX), and product engineering, I specialize in building modern, responsive web applications using React and Next.js.

Intending to further specialize in web accessibility, I bring a background in Psychology that fuels my understanding of people and human behaviour. This unique perspective enables me to create user interfaces and web experiences beyond technical requirements, to understand users and business needs.

As a lifelong learner, I always seek new challenges and thrive in dynamic environments that push me to grow and learn new things.

Since 2023, I’ve been mentoring in Geek Girls Portugal, an organization dedicated to helping women enter the tech industry, grow their careers, and build confidence in their tech journeys. This experience has strengthened my commitment to mentorship, diversity, and fostering a supportive tech community.

Beyond crafting web experiences, you’ll probably find me with a cup of coffee or tea, reading, listening to a podcast, or hanging out with my cats.
