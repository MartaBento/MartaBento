### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

A frontend engineer passionate about crafting inclusive and accessible user experiences that everyone can enjoy. My mantra is that the web should be for everyone.

I aim to specialize in web accessibility somewhere soon. Working in this field and being a naturally curious person, I also particularly enjoy the UI/UX and Product Design field - this knowledge and interest allow me to grasp some product concepts and think about the web in a more broad spectrum beyond engineering, focused on user needs.

Having a background in Psychology created an essential foundation for my understanding of people and human behaviour. I thrive in the intersection between tech and users, hence my interest in everything related to user interfaces and user experience, being more product or code-wise.

I'm also a lifelong learner, constantly seeking new challenges to keep me engaged and driven - from coding to plants to learning a new language or skill - I need to be constantly driven to learn new things and to always be in an environment that keeps me challenged.
